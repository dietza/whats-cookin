# What's Cookin'? 

  -a Javascript project by Allison Dietz and Jeff Woltjen
  
## Overview 

This project explores the concepts of choosing classes, organizing data across large arrays, array prototype iterator methods, and test-driven development implementing chai frameworks. The project spanned approximately 10 days as part of Turing Front End Module 2's paired project. 

## Challenges 
  - Organizing data into classes
  This was the first project at Turing where the amount of data avaialble gave programmers discretion in terms of how that data was organized and displayed. There were several available options but the challenge lied in picking an option and seeing it through.
  
  - Instantiating these classes on the DOM
  In connection with the above, instantiating these classes as object literals with associated parameters onto the document object model in a coherent and aesthetically pleasing manner was perhaps the most challenging aspect of this project. It required the programmers to slow down to visualize what data was actually being passed through to which constructors, why, etc. 
  
  - Accessing nested data with array prototype methods
  Only array prototype iterator methods are used ot access data nested in arrays. No for loops have been used in this project. ES6 syntax use has also been encouraged and widely implemented. 
  
## Victories

  - Getting recipe cards to display on the DOM 
  Definitely a huge victory for this project, as it requires the programmers to grab data from multiple locations and present it in newly created objects interpolated into the html. 
  
  - Conquering Merge Conflicts
  Allison in particular had encountered a series of nasty merge conflicts during the construction of this project which she managed to tackle in a professional manner and put the monster back into Pandora's box.
